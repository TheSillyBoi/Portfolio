    <p>I am a 14 year old(As of 2025) who's obsessed with Coding, Gaming, Learning tech, and Hanging out with friends!
        As of the time of me last updating this website, I am currently learning Rust, CSS, HTML, and Bash, and I have been programming off and on for about 3 years now.
        If you want to check out anything I've made, you can check out my GitHub page at https://github.com/thesillyboi, or you can see the code for this website at the link in the top bar.

    <p>
         I have 2 Cats named Maginos and Natasha, the brown and black one is Natasha, and the Grey one is Maginos.
         Natasha is named after Natasha Romanoff, the full name for Black Widow in Marvel, and Maginos is named after the wizard from the board game <em>Mice and Mystics</em>.

        The reasoning behind the naming scheme of this website was an inside joke between me and my friend Calvin(@confused99), where we planned to make a website together, and he couldn't come up with a name, so I tried to name it calvin :skull: but it got automatically changed to calvin-skull- , but he gave up working on it, so I've been working on this alone now.
