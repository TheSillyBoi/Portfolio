# This website was created to learn HTML/CSS and maybe even eventually Javascript, but that'll probably be later in my time working on it, once I have a good base to start from
I([@TheSillyBoi](https://github.com/thesillyboi/)/Adrian Tennies) meant to create this with @confused99(Calvin)

The reasoning behind the name was a joke where it was both of our first experiences making a website(not including Google Sites/Wix/Canva/similar tools), and I decided that he had to name the website, and he couldn't figure out how to name it, and he didn't come up with anything, so I tried to name it "Calvin\:skull: so it would look like Calvin:skull:, but it was by default changed to Portfolio. which I never cared enough to change"

 I just gave up and started writing one myself under the same repo, and if he ever comes back to it, I'll change it so there's different pages for each of us, but I don't see a reason right now, as he's seemingly fully given up contributing, to it.

> If you notice that there's issues in the formatting, or if you want to contribute to this, please help with it or atleast mention it, this is my first time making a site without Google Sites/Wix/Canva, so there will most definitely be issues with it.  

*A majority of the Icons/Logos on v1 of the site were from [Icons8](icons8.com).*
