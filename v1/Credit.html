            The large majority of this website was created by Adrian Tennies(if you don't know who I am, I'm confused about what you've been doing on this website), 
            Calvin(@confused99) is the reason why I started this website, as he wanted to make a website together, but he quit development on it after 15 minutes, so I started trying to make a personal website, and this is what I have so far.
            <br>
            <br>
            All icons/Logos used in this website were from on <a href = https://icons8.com>Icons8</a>, other than images of Myself, and My Cats on the About me page, and Images of my Projects on the "My Projects" page.
            <br>
            <br>
            Artificial Intelligence(specifically Anthropic's Claude 4.0 model) was used in the making of this website(Only for explaining, it was not writing the code).
          <br>
          <br>
          All references to people in this style ex:(@thesillyboi), are referring to people's GitHub profiles, who you should check out, because they're very talented individuals.  
          <br>
          <br>
          The My Projects is a showcase of my public projects, with the titles being hyperlinks to the repo, yes, I know it's not much, but I'm just starting out.

          There may be minor issues with this website looking incorrectly on Gecko, or more likely, Webkit-based browsers or Browsers in a resolution that isn't 16x9 or 16x10, as almost all testing was done using VSCode's Simple Browser or Firefox
