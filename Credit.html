            The large majority of this website was created by Adrian Tennies(if you don't know who I am, I'm confused about what you've been doing on this website), 
            Calvin(@confused99) is the reason why I started this website, as he wanted to make a website together, but he quit development on it, so I started trying to make a personal website, and this is what I have so far.

            All icons used in this website were from on <a href = https://icons8.com>Icons8</a>, other than images of Myself, and My Cats on the About me page.
            <br>
            <br>
            Artificial Intelligence(specifically Anthropic's Claude 4.0 model) was used in the making of this website(Only for explaining, it was not writing the code, I'm not a vibe coder).
